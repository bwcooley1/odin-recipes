          <h2>An Italian classic</h2>
          <p>This is the classic recipe used by Italians for a simple yet flavorful pasta. It's the first dish that comes to mind on busy weeknights, fuel for late-night cram sessions like for “la note prima degli esami” (the night before final exams), impressing a boyfriend or girlfriend, or their parents, the times when the fridge is empty, or you just need a light starter to your meal. This is the epitome of comfort food in Italy.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>1/2 (12oz) package Thick Spaghetti</li>
              <li>6 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
              <li>1 hot Chili Pepper, seeded and minced</li>
              <li>1 Ckive Garlic, minced</li>
              <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian Parsley</li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
              <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and reserve 1 cup of cooking water.</li>
              <li>Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add chile and garlic; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1/4 cup reserved pasta water and stir. Add drained pasta to the skillet and toss. Add extra pasta water if needed to keep the spaghetti moist but not soggy. Mix in parsley. Toss again and plate. Top with remaining olive oil, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
          </ol>
